djangoShop
==========

This is a Django shop that sells bikes, books and music. It began as an university project but I decided to expand it and use almost all the html5 features that we was taught.

You can access the demo on heroku:

> Due to the Heroku's free plan, multimedia is removed after an hour of inactivity.
> Soon, I'll try to host multimedia in my Dropbox account...
