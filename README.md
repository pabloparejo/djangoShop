djangoShop
==========

This is a Django shop that sells bikes, books and music. [Expanded University Project]

The project has no database, to use it you should try:
  1) $ ./manage.py syncdb
  2) Add some products through the admin site


I am looking forward to upload it to heroku as a demo, soon...
